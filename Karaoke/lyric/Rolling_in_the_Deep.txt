[00:0.849] The scars of your love remind me of us
[00:5.634] They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
[00:10.586] The scars of your love they leave me breathless, I can't help feeling
[00:17.707] We could have had it all
[00:22.903] Rolling in the deep
[00:27.065] You had my heart inside of your hand
[00:31.637] And you played it to the beat
